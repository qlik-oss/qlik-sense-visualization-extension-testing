# qlik-sense-visualization-extension-testing

This is a scaffolding project aimed to explain, and help you set up, the testing of your Qlik Sense visualization extensions. At this time, there is no automated integration of the tests to your project, so fixtures and test files has to be manually copied to your extension project.

It is strongly recommended that you start with quick and robust unit tests to cover your code, and complement these tests with component and integration tests.
